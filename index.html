        <h3>IT Interest</h3>
        <p>
          My interest in IT is varied, and has been present for most of my life! From a very young age, I've had access
          to technology such as computers, televisions, gaming consoles and the likes. Pointing to a specific point in
          my life which seriously peaked my interest in IT, was on my 12th birthday, when I received a hand me down
          iphone. Some of the specific interests I have in IT are: video games, web-development, PC building and
          keyboard building; all of which I also have extensive experience in.
        </p>
        <p>
          My university career path has been an interesting one. Initially, after completing highschool i studied for a
          Bachelor of Science at Melbourne University. After a year of studies there, I was under the impression that it
          was too broad of a university course for me, and shifted to Deakin University studying a Bachelor of
          Biomedical Science. At this point, I continued the course for two and a half years, hoping to see and
          experience a subject, an event or anything at all, that would finally reveal and show my interest in the
          field, however it never arised. As such, I took the plunge and partook in a 6 month coding bootcamp, and from
          then onwards I never looked back! I developed my own project management app, linked to github commits, and
          used this project to apply for jobs all over Melbourne; and was fortunate enough to land a full-time web
          developer role, which I am currently working at. As for why I decided to come to RMIT, was the ability for me
          to study completely online at my own pace, along with RMIT being a well respected university when it comes to
          the Information Technology field.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main things I hope to achieve during my studies here, is a broader and better understanding of
          concepts which I either have self taught myself, or only received a very brief introduction to during my
          coding bootcamp. Such concepts such as: Sorting Algorithms, programing styles (i.e OOP), networking skills and
          the likes.

        <p>
          I am interested in IT from my childhood. My uncle was a computer programmer, I read one of his book and other
          books about computers
        </p>
        <h3>IT Experience</h3>
        <p>
          I got some experience in mainframe programming when I was studying in university. As first personal computers
          became available, I bought one of them. It could be programmed in Assembler and Basic and did some
          programming. But western personal computers were not affordable in USSR and Russia and my career went to
          Mechanical Engineering. When difficulties started to find a job for Mechanical Engineer, I had got a degree in
          area of IT and worked as a system administrator for UNIX systems and help IT officer in one company in Russia.
          After my migration to Australia, I worked as proprietary software developer and help IT officer here. The
          course Bachelor of IT in RMIT is suitable for me by its syllabus and because it has four study periods per
          year, this allows to distribute studying load more evenly. RMIT has a pretty high rank among Australian
          universities

          Most of my spare time is spent playing video games, mostly single player games. Favourite games pretty much
          come from three franchises; Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid, and The Legend of Zelda. Once in a blue moon I’ll
          try out an MMO, but I get way too invested and spend every other moment playing until I get to a point a
          couple of months later and realise I just need to stop. Most notably with FFXIV, which every couple of years
          I’ll pick up again.
        </p>
        <h3>IT Interest</h3>
        <p>
          My interest in IT began at a fairly young age. Playing around with the family computer when I was probably
          about 9 years old, fascinated by the internet, the amazing graphics of the old 8-bit DOS games, and just
          exploring though all the systems, settings and files that every computer has.
        </p>
        <h3>IT Experience</h3>
        <p>
          While I have no formal training in IT, I have taught myself a decent amount (mostly through Google). When I
          was younger my father collected used computers and I had the time of my life pulling them apart and playing
          around with the hardware. (I was always better at pulling them apart than I was at putting them back
          together). At work I’m the one anyone goes to with any IT issues before contacting our actual IT department.
          As I have been with the company for so long I’ve learned quite a bit about how our systems work and what the
          most common fixes are. And if I don’t know I’ll generally tinker around until I get it, with a pretty good
          success rate!

        <h3>IT Interest</h3>
        <p>
          My interest in IT is constantly expanding. Every day I find a new area of IT that I’d love to explore. An area
          I’m passionate about is computer hardware and software building/troubleshooting. I enjoy building computer
          systems, but I also really enjoy digging into software and hardware to find & resolve any issues. I think my
          IT interest started at a young age when my mother introduced me to video games, she had a PS1 and she showed
          me games like Crash Bandicoot and Sonic. Later, I got a DS and I played games like The Legend of Zelda. Since
          then, I’ve been in love with video games and all the technology that comes with it.
        </p>
        <h3>IT Experience</h3>
        <p>
          I’m not sure if there was a particular event that caused my interest in IT, but it was definitely my mother
          who introduced me to all different types of technology. Since a young age, I’ve had access to iPods, Smart
          phones, Tablets, laptops and more. Because I’ve had access to these platforms for so long, I’ve been learning
          about all the different operating systems and how each device/environment works.

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy gaming on pretty much every platform from PS5 to PCs. I really enjoy building PCs as I have built two
          for myself so far. I would do more of this but as we all know the parts are extremely expensive (especially
          recently.) I also enjoy going out and drinking at bars and catching up with Uni friends and school friends
          occasionally. Although not as much recently due to the pandemic.
        </p>
        <h3>IT Interest</h3>
        <p>
          My interest in IT is mainly due to my fascination with tech and mostly new and upcoming tech. Ever since I was
          a child, I had obsessed over pretty much anything electronic I could get my hands on. From my father’s first
          COMPAQ desktop computer to the old Nokia flip phones.
        </p>
        <h3>IT Experience</h3>
        <p>
          I don’t have any professional experience with IT. My only experience is from watching YouTube videos from
          popular tech creators such as Linus Tech Tips. I hope to gain valuable knowledge from RMIT and hopefully
          graduate with a Bachelor of IT. I specifically chose RMIT to study at because they offer a fully online
          Degree. This is especially important to me as I currently work 4-5 days a week already and would find
          travelling to Uni very difficult.

        <p>
          Combined with an existing curiosity in electronics and programming, an interest in IT was a natural
          progression. I have since built my own PC and helped others as well. I also briefly studied engineering
          science at flinders university and encountered some limited coding during that.

        </p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>
          A completed Higher Education was evident in every member's Ideal Job prospect. Most Jobs require individuals
          to obtain proficiency in coding languages. However, the languages varied based on the Individuals job title.
          Another evident skill set displayed in all job prospects was the soft skills required from individuals, which
          were the ability to be...
        </p>
        <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
        <p>
          <span>Communicative:</span> the ability to actively listen, communicate the issue among team members and
          provide product knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Problem-Solving Skills:</span> Individuals obtain a sense of attention to detail. They are identifying
          systematic problems and ensuring to be able to troubleshoot errors that occur along the way of a network or
          program.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Data Analysis/ Critical Thinking:</span> Individuals are encouraged to be able to analyze a large volume
          of data and identify patterns and trends within a system. Also, there is a requirement to be critical in
          finding solutions to significant scale errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Time Management:</span> The ability for Individuals to meet required deadlines and ensuring that the
          programs are properly executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Reliability:</span> To be a reliable team member with ability to work independently with minimal
          supervision
        </p>
        <p>
          The obtained soft skills stated above were based on the common rising skills within all the said IT work
          fields. It was also evident in the Burning Glass Technology, which highlighted communication and
          problem-solving as the top leading skills recommended for Technological selection. To our surprise, the
          analytical skill was recorded as the seventeen on the list. Analytical skills were necessary for the team
          based on effectively finding solutions and creating effective pathways in resolving technical errors.
          According to the report, the third place is organizational skills, which are essential in effective structure
          when targeting daily technical requirements. Which allowed us to think and also consider that organizational
          skills are imperative before the stages of resolving a bug
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
        <p>
          Technical skills were very hard to assess as various fields required various coding languages. The technical
          skills were stated based on the simple notion of skills that reappeared in each prospect.

          software development security. To do that, he faces a very diverse set of tasks and demands, i.e. he needs to
          provide computer forensic support, write company policy, support compliance efforts, and provide
          business-to-business (B2B) risk-assessment services, web applications testing, readiness team exercises,
          incident response services, tabletop exercises for simulated incidents, awareness training for general staff
          and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information Security Manager interacts with members of his security team, software engineers, system
          administrators, members of HR team, production managers, high management, network engineers and many other
          staff members. Practically Information Security Manager must interact and cooperate with all levels of workers
          in his company, and not all of them are IT specialists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information Security Manager spends his time at meetings with various groups of stuff. He meets mangers of
          departments to discuss their current security problems and preventive actions present reports to high level of
          management. Also Security manager assess risks related to outside vendors and develops code of conduct
          documentation for the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most challenging aspects of the position of Information Security Manager are large diversity of
          responsibilities, work day is intensive and work hours can go up to 55 –60 per week.

          <h3 style="display:inline-block"> Albert Yang – Amazon Software engineer </h3>
          <img class="open-link" src="assets/images/open-link.png" />
        </a>
        <p>
          Albert yang is an Amazon Software engineer. On both the Seattle edition and the Work From Home edition of his “A Day In The Life” he does various tasks such as coding projects and daily meetings with his team called a stand-up meeting. On the Seattle edition he also has a meeting with a Team Project Manager about a “Secret Project”. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the Seattle Edition being filmed during Covid-19, the office that he is working in seems empty compared to normal circumstances. He also mentions that most people are still working from home. The meetings he has are with other IT professional colleagues of his and in the Work From Home edition, due to Covid19 he only interacts via video calls. Additionally, he seems to mostly only interact with his colleagues or supervisors. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Seattle edition, Albert spends most of his time at his office desk doing his coding and project work. It seems that his role allows for a flexible work environment, as throughout the day he works in various locations within his office and goes out during the day to go to the gym. Due to the pandemic, the work from home edition demonstrated how some software engineers have adjusted to the work conditions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I would say that the most challenging part of his position would be completing work by the set deadlines. It would be difficult to ensure that the work is up to the high standard that the world has come to expect from Amazons services, as well as producing this work by the given deadlines. Furthermore, another difficult aspect of this would be the fact that his work could be put on hold at any second if there is an emergency or bug that needs to be fixed.

          <h3>What does it do?</h3>
          <p>
            Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence, which is defined as the ability of a machine to
            imitate human intelligence and behaviour. This model deals with the practical applications of logical and
            mathematical deductions. An extremely useful technology which allows machines to learn from data and self
            improve, in which the use of statistical methods and algorithms are trained in order to create
            classifications or predictions.
          </p>
          <p>The are three primary functions of a machine learning system.</p>
          <p>
            <span>Descriptive:</span> where the system uses the data provided in order to explain what has happened.
          </p>
          <p><span>Predictive:</span> where the system uses the data provided in order to predict what will happen.</p>
          <p>
            <span>Prescriptive:</span> where the system uses the data provided in order to make suggestions for what
            action to take.
          </p>
          <p>The methods in which machine learning works fall in to three main categories</p>
          <h3>Supervised machine learning</h3>
          <p>
            Supervised machine learning uses labelled datasets to train algorithms to assign a classification to data or
            to predict outcomes, which will learn and grow more accurate over time. An algorithm like this would be
            trained with pictures of dogs, apples, or anything else, all labelled by humans. The machine would be able
            to learn ways to identify and categorise these different images on its own.
          </p>
          <h3>Unsupervised machine learning</h3>
          <p>
            Unsupervised machine learning uses unlabelled data and looks for patterns or trends that may not be what are
            explicitly being looked for. This type of algorithm can look through online sales data and identify what
            different demographics have been purchasing and may give insight to future trends which can then be taken
            advantage of.
          </p>
          <h3>Reinforcement machine learning</h3>
          <p>
            Reinforcement machine learning is a technique that allows a software model to learn by trial and error in a
            more interactive environment to take the most appropriate action by establishing a reward system.
            Reinforcement learning can train models to drive autonomous cars or play games by telling the machine when
            it made a right decision, or by correcting an incorrect decision.
          </p>
          <p>Machine learning is currently being used in many ways.</p>
          <p>
            <span>Recommendation algorithms</span> are utilised by corporations such as Netflix and YouTube to make
            suggestions on what movies, TV shows or videos to watch based on your previous viewing history by analysing
            your preferences based on what you have watched or liked in the past and finding similar media that you are
            more likely to enjoy. These same algorithms are used by Amazon and other online retailers to provide
            suggestions on your next purchase based on what you have previously purchased or looked at.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Object detection and image analysis</span> are used to analyse images for multiple points of
            information in order to do things like identifying different people in a picture, or being able to tell the
            difference between a cat and a dog. It is also used in the development of autonomous cars to identify its
            surroundings and acquire traffic data in order to make to the most logical and safest decisions possible
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Speech and sound recognition</span> are used to provide linguistic data for digital assistants such as
            Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant. Every time a request is made to a digital assistant, the voice
            command is sent to the internet via the cloud, where it is reviewed and interpreted, then a relevant
            response is sent back to the device. If a response is not relevant then the user is able to correct it, and
            this new information is used in future requests, and as such continue to learn and develop more relevant
            responses.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Chatbots and helplines</span> use machine learning algorithms for humans to speak with machines,
            instead of another human. These algorithms use natural language processing with bots to come up with
            relevant responses based on data collected from previous conversations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Fraud detection</span> can be applied by machine learning by analysing patterns, such as spending
            habits, how much is normally spend and where it’s being spent. If a transaction outside the normal
            acceptable parameters it can be flagged as a potentially fraudulent transaction. Similar processes can also
            be used to identify spam emails and fraudulent log-in attempts.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
          <p>
            Machine learning in recent history has already significantly impacted basically every element of our lives.
            From the media we consume and the products we buy by utilising recommendation algorithms. The devices we use
            every day, our phones, computers and lights which utilise countless algorithms between image and sound
            recognition and task automation, and even getting to work by analysing traffic prediction, whether you are
            driving in your car which uses machine learning to help maximise fuel efficiency, or if you’re on the bus
            whose metro system analyses traffic data to create the most efficient schedule possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The future of machine learning will see an incredible advancement and efficiency to already smart cities, by
            using traffic prediction data to improve traffic flow, increase the usage and efficiency of public
            transportation and be able to adapt when circumstances change, whether it be a car accident and a surge or
            tourists. Ultimately affecting every single person living in and visiting the area.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many industries in which machine learning will continue to increase efficiency. E-commerce
            utilises predictive analysis not just for the customers by understanding preferences and behaviours, but
            also in managing inventories, and optimising logistics and warehousing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Machine learning is also used on both fronts for the job market. Employers utilise this technology to sort
            through resumes while searching for ideal candidates. This unfortunately means that a resume may not ever
            even be seen by a potential employer, as the automated process has already rejected the majority of
            applications. Job seekers can also utilise this technology, by applying the same process to their own resume
            to discover where any adjustments may be needed whether its adding or removing keywords, skills etc. There
            are also automated resume builders for job seekers which can create an ideal resume after inputting their
            own information.
          </p>
          <h3>How will this affect me?</h3>
          <p>
            The biggest impact to myself would be the advancement of smart home technologies. I already have a small
            smart ecosystem consisting of Apple products and multiple smart lighting systems such as Philips Hue and
            Nanoleaf. With these devices I can automate certain aspects of my home life which can help alter my mood or
            make things more efficient. Using HomeKit, when I come home after dark, my lights throughout the hallway and
            living area turn on a soft, warm relaxing light so I’m not blinded by intense, stimulating light and the tv
            will turn on. If I forget to turn off the TV, it will turn itself and all the lights in the house off when I
            leave the house, or when I go to bed by simply saying, “Hey Siri, goodnight” As I wake up, the lights in my
            bedroom slowly turn on and get brighter to help wake me up.
          </p>
          <p>
            The advancement and availability of these technologies will likely soar even more once prices drop and
            accessibility increases. My coffee machine may create a nice brew as soon as I wake up. The car could park
            itself in the garage and the house would close all the windows and doors if there is a severe weather
            warning. Robot vacuums could not only vacuum and mop, but wipe down countertops, clean windows and take
            waste out to the smart bins, which could then take themselves out on bin day by utilising the same
            technology used for automated vehicles
          </p>
          <p>
            An advanced smart home would relieve an enormous amount of pressure of daily life. Without worrying about
            cleaning, cooking, doing laundry or other chores leaves open possibilities to do things I enjoy, or engage
            in activities to help better myself such as studying, going to the gym, or make attempts at being social.

        <div class="raspberry-pi hidden fadeIn">
          <h3>What does it do?</h3>
          <p>
            Raspberry Pi is non-profit, charity organisation which consider its purpose as helping to make electronics,
            software development and prototyping affordable and possible for wide masses of enthusiasts and makers, to
            attract school students to university degrees in Computer Science. It was reaction to decline the interest
            to IT in society after bursting IT bubble in the beginning of 2000’s. Founders of Raspberry Pi decided to
            provide a small, very inexpensive single board computer (SBC) for general purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            This idea has turned out to be very successful. A total of 30 million devices had been soldby December 2019
            (see Illustration 1). Anumber of similar SBCs with open-source hardware architecture has emerged on the
            market after that. Among them Banana Pi, BeagleBoardcan be named.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/images/tweet.JPG" />
          <p>
            The applications of Raspberry Pi boards have been extended far outside of educational area (the Rasbery Pi
            is used in almost a quarter of all UK secondary schools(NComputing, 2020)). At homes, it is used as a very
            affordable desktop PC for retro-gaming, network data storage and building cluster computer systems
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, Merton Council (UK) significantly reduced cost of its IT infrastructure by using small and
            cheap computers based on Raspberry Pi (NComputing, 2020).
          </p>
          <p>
            The University of Cambridge, one ofthe world’s top research universities upgraded its IT. For that, the
            university has chosen the Raspberry Pi based Citrix Workspace as a desktop for 15,000 users; desktop PC
            consuming 450 W that’s powered 24/7 was replaced by Raspberry Pi which consumes between 5W and 15W, that
            brings a substantial energy saving (Citrix Systems, 2020).
          </p>
          <p>
            Évreux Portes de Normandie (EPN) an inter-communal organisation, centred in the city of Évreux (France). It
            uses Stratodesk NoTouch Desktop, software which provides manages secure thin clients on numerous end-point
            Raspberry Pi computers (Stratodesk, 2019).
          </p>
          <p>
            At the moment, Raspberry Pi provides a number of variations of Raspberry Pi, from smaller, low-cost SBC to
            more powerful SBC, capable to serve as an affordable, economical desktop PC. Other manufacturers provide a
            lot of various extension boards and accessories for Raspberry Pi. The last development are Raspberry Pi
            400and Pico, they extend applications of Raspberry Pi even further.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company which designs and manufactures low-cost single board
            micro-controller kits. These boards can be programmed using C/C++ programming language and special Arduino
            Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The simplified API for access to the outside sensor and actuators,
            that does not need deep knowledge of micro-controller programming and makes it possible to use them by
            students and amateur hobbyists
          </p>
          <p>
            Like Raspberry Pi, Arduino was organised at the beginning of 2000’s (in 2005 to be precise) with the prime
            purpose of using it in education. But Arduino boards have become very popular not only university students.
            Over the years, our products have been the brains behind thousands of projects, from everyday objects to
            complex scientific instruments.(Arduino, 2021) Special kits are developed for different levels of education
            including basic kits for middle school students, robotic arm and IoT kits for high school and university
            students
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of others produce, design and manufacture Arduino compatible boards and add-ons. Some Arduino boards
            are widely used by hobbyists and professionals to build IoT radio systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company OpenEVSE started in February 2011 with a simple experiment to try to generate the SAE J1772
            pilot signal on anArduino Development Board. One experiment led to another to another until a prototype
            J1772 compatible controller was born. With lots of feedback and interest from the great folks on the "My
            Nissan LEAF" Forum a few boards were offered to other hardware hackers. What started as a few boards (6
            built in the first batch) turned into more and more... Today, OpenEVSE powers charging stations from many
            manufactures all over the world. (Open Evse, 2020)
          </p>
          <p>
            The modern Arduino boards have capabilities to be programmed using high-level programming languages with
            support of Machine Learning. Also, Arduino boards are capable to do radio connections using various
            protocols.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
          <p>
            Development of such small computer systems has changed approach to howelectronic devices are used and
            designed. Making electronic boards simple to understand and program, reducing their price tag, Arduino,
            Raspberry Pi, etc have made electronics affordable to wide mass of hobbyists and students. It means that
            more peoples come in the field of Computer Engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first model of Raspberry Pi, the Raspberry Pi 1 Model B, was presented in February, 2012 and it was not
            expected to make so significant impact in next 10 years. The original target of its creators was to promote
            computer science knowledge in school students and underdeveloped countries as well. The original Raspberry
            Pi mission has been accomplished: the number of applicants to study Computer Science at Cambridge University
            has gone up from 200 in 2008 to 1400+ in 2020(The Index Project, 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            Now days, Raspberry Pi is the unofficial standard entry point into STEAM areas such as mechanotronics,
            computer hardware engineering, robotics, computer programming and many others. Another significant result
            that it had was introducing many people to less traditional computer technologies operational system Linux
            and programming language Python that they have never thought as primary before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arduino is different from Raspberry Pi, it is a board with microcontroller,not an SBC, but its impact is
            similar. Despite a number of affordable microcontroller boards probably would will be, the number of such
            boards would not be so high as in the case of the same open-source development environment. Instead, it
            surely would bea number of competing incompatible IDEs from chip manufacturers, many of them difficult in
            use for amateurs, proprietary and close-sourced.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, easiness of use and affordability of small computing devices like Raspberry Pi, Arduino and
            Makey Makeys has attracted a lot of new people in areas of microelectronics and computer science and made
            possible creation of not expensive projects in automatization, robotics, etc which was not possible in
            before.
          </p>
          <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
          <p>
            Arduino, Raspberry Pi and other small electronic devices do not affect my life directly, but I do some
            Arduino project for other peoples. In general, there are thousands of Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects
            which can be used in very different areas. Many of these projects arerelated with the “smart homes” concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            Raspberry Pi can be used to build an affordable home surveillance system. Maybe I will use a powerful model
            of Raspberry Pi as a very chip and economical PC and device for home network (web-server, firewall, network
            monitoring tool, Network Attached Storage (NAS) device, etc).
          </p>
          <p>Raspberry Pi and Arduino can be combined to build a home automation system (Nightsite, 2013).</p>

        <div class="cloud-services hidden fadeIn">
          <h3>What does it do?</h3>
          <p>
            Clouds and servers are a technology that is ever evolving. Cloud computing is the use of online servers,
            databases, software, and systems to provide computing services over the internet. The main difference, when
            comparing servers and cloud servers is that cloud servers are stored online over the internet. Whereas local
            servers are stored in physical locations on networks of Hard drives and other physical storage solutions.
          </p>
          <p>With cloud technology the main benefits are speed, reliability, cost, and security.</p>
          <h3>Cost</h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to on site servers, there is a big demand for power electricity and cooling. All of which are
            not cost effective. There is also the need for more workers that are needed to establish data centres and
            help to run the software. The use of cloud technology means we can bypass most of these costs.
          </p>
          <h3>Reliability</h3>
          <p>
            Cloud technology allows users to store large amounts of data online to servers. And can be backed up to any
            location from anywhere in the world. Users do not need to spend money on hard drives when they are plenty of
            free cloud storage services provided. And these often have many options for different storage plans so its
            extremely flexible and can suit the users needs. It is also beneficial to businesses because of this reason
            and is much less expensive for them
          </p>
          <h3>Speed</h3>
          <p>
            Cloud services are available as self service and are available on demand most of the time. Substantial
            amounts of data can be compiled and stored in quick speeds. Internet technology has improved at an
            exponential level. In the current day data can be accessed almost instantaneously from around the world
            thanks to the internet and cloud technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cloud computing is a quickly evolving technology. There are many aspects of cloud computing that are likely
            to develop in the next few years.
          </p>
          <p>
            One such example is the amount of data we can store in the cloud. All forms of data are increasing in size
            very quickly. And thus, the demand for cloud data storage is also increasing at a quick rate. This demand
            has made data centres become more competitive and led them to offer more value and storage for much less
            cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another future development is businesses going serverless. “The demand for serverless computing is expected
            to grow by 25% from 2021 and 2026.” (Shradda's, 2021). Going serverless means that businesses can develop
            and run applications without having the need to have physical servers. Applications will run on servers but
            there will no need for server maintenance on the businesses’ end. Instead, the cloud service provider does
            all the maintenance and upgrading.
          </p>
          <p>
            AI in cloud computing is also one of the biggest trends now. For example, google search uses AI that lives
            in the cloud. AI and machine learning is a large part of why Google is so proficient in obtaining the search
            results for every user. AI and cloud together are one of the most quickly developing technologies. Google is
            not the only company that uses AI in this manner. Instagram, Facebook are just a few from the many that use
            such algorithms and AI to understand user’s data and improve their services.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
          <p>
            One of the impacts of cloud services is the cost savings. Especially with businesses. Once cloud systems are
            setup, the cost savings for companies are pretty good. Access to data is simple, fast, and cost effective.
            Also, most cloud offerings allow pay as you go system. So, there is no extra costs when there is an excess
            of storage capabilities when its not needed. This is highly effective as it allows organisations to only pay
            for what they need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another key factor when considering cloud systems is the environmental impact. Hosting servers on the cloud
            instead of locally means there is less of a carbon footprint. This is because there is less reliance on
            powering of physical servers. And thus, less use of electricity. “A Pike Research report predicted data
            centre energy consumption will drop by 31% from 2010 to 2020 based on the adoption of cloud computing and
            other virtual data options.” (SalesForce) .
          </p>
          <p>
            Businesses are much more likely to be more secure when using cloud systems. The cloud software providers can
            more often bring effective updates to the software. Hence providing more reliable security for
            organisations. This however can be a negative because, usually when cloud systems are not used. There is an
            IT workforce that are involved in the maintenance of security, system updates, and infrastructure. The use
            of cloud means that these workers are not necessarily needed as much anymore, and thus decreasing employment
            for workers in this field.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there are still more benefits to the use of cloud by businesses. Cloud technology allows much more
            collaboration between different teams. Communication is much more easier using data from the cloud which is
            much more readily available. Workers from all different fields like engineers, digital marketing teams, UI
            designers and much more, can collaborate more efficiently.
          </p>
          <h3>How does this affect me?</h3>
          <p>
            Cloud computing has had a massive impact on us and the general public. There are a wide range of cloud
            technologies available for public use and are most of the time free. All major operating systems provide
            free to use cloud storage. Google, apple, Microsoft and much all have their own offerings. Their software is
            easily run on any operating systems. For example, Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud storage can be used on Android
            devices, iOS devices, even on MacOS and Windows. This means that users are not locked to one ecosystem and
            can have their data available from all their devices. So, for example if I had some documents on my Windows
            PC I would save the data as a backup on the cloud using OneDrive. And then if I went to travel to work and I
            have my MacBook which is running a completely different Operating system; I would then be able to access the
            same files from my laptop because OneDrive is able to be used on many different types of devices. Most of
            the popular cloud services are available for free and only charge the user if they want more premium and
            high-capacity plans. Another benefit that I personally have from cloud computing is my data being more
            secure. iPhones have iCloud backup services that are free to use. It automatically backs up important data
            regularly. On iCloud you can choose specifically what kind of data you want to backup. So, you do not
            unnecessarily waste all the free storage you have initially. There have been times where I have had my phone
            damaged and there is no way to access the data from the phone directly. But thanks to Apple’s iCloud backup
            services, all I must do is to use another iOS device and restore the phone from the data that was saved from
            the old device on iCloud.
          </p>
          <p>These are just a few examples of how cloud technology has impacted me positively.</p>

        <div class="autonomous-vehicles hidden fadeIn">
          <h3>What does it do?</h3>
          <p>
            Fully autonomous vehicles, such as cars and trucks are capable of operating without any human input. However
            partial automation has been part of many cars for some time. Automatic transmission and cruise control both
            aids, reduce the amount of human input needed to successfully drive. Advanced driver assistance systems have
            continued to be developed and deployed in modern cars including lane assistance to keep the driver on their
            part of the road, blind spot detection to avoid collisions, automatic parking and much more. All these
            technologies contribute to the trend towards fully driverless cars and the technological advances required
            for such systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            A vehicles development can be defined within the 6 levels of autonomy system defined by the Society of
            Automotive Engineering (SAE). Level 0, no automation. Level 1, driver assistance. Level 2, partial
            automation. Level 3, conditional automation. Level 4, high automation. Level 5, full automation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leading cars available for consumers are usually around automation level 2 and 3. They operate with
            combinations of many technologies. These include GPS navigation, a network of cameras, lidar, radar and
            other sensors. Mercedes drive pilot system is one level 3 system. IT allows for the car to drive itself in
            highway conditions including high traffic or traffic jams. The driver must remain ready to take over if the
            system requests, however.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the commercial side ‘Waymo’ operates a limited access self-driving taxi service aiming for level 4 or 5
            automation functionality. Phoenix, Arizona provides dry sunny and flat conditions to simplify the conditions
            for the early stages of such a service. Variable conditions such as undulation, wet or lower visibility
            environments will continue to pose new challenges for self-driving AIs as usage expands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other kinds of vehicles, trucks and their specific issues – One company developing autonomous trucks ‘tu
            simple’ has had success as well. With drivers manually controlling the truck at each end of the delivery
            route, over 1500kms of highway was successfully navigated autonomously by a truck delivering watermelons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legality of autonomous vehicles is another obstacle in some locations. Current motor vehicle legislation
            in Australia uses terms such as ‘driver’ and ‘control’ who that would refer to when a driverless car breaks
            road rules or injures members of the community is unclear and rules must be drafted for such events.
            Additionally, privacy protection may also be an issue as location would be tracked and possibly accompanied
            by personal information, facial recognition (to verify ownership) or even vital sign information monitoring
            the condition of the driver. Who would have access to this information? What are they allowed to do with it?
            Will users who don’t wish to give said information be locked out of all services? All questions that must be
            addressed within a legal framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            The security of autonomous vehicles in the event of a cyber attack is also a consideration especially when
            manual driver override is not a feasible option. If control of the car is not compromised, sensitive data as
            mentioned above could still be at risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            A major technical limitation in the progress of self-driving autonomous vehicles is the lack of training
            data. Machine learning systems such as the AI that controls autonomous vehicles requires extraordinary
            amounts of data to perform well. The issue in this scenario is that this data is extremely expensive to
            collect. Other applications of machine learning are often digital and can run a simulation or game 1000s of
            times simultaneously to collect data. As companies continue to collect real world driving data as more cars
            capable to collect data hit the road and further simulate scenarios for the AI to learn from this should
            improve and continue to develop.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the likely Impact</h3>
          <p>
            As autonomous vehicles become both more accessible and more affordable there will be a range of societal
            impacts. As those currently unable to drive themselves for physical, psychological and other reasons will
            have flexibility and mobility not previously afforded to them. Elderly members of the community who have
            lost the right to drive, or ability to do so safely, will continue to be allowed to travel in their daily
            lives in the manner to which they are accustomed. Disabled individuals who are not able to drive will
            acquire a new level on independence as they will no longer rely on others from transportation. Driving will
            become more accessible and long distances more manageable for everyone. It should also be safer as drunk
            driving, inattentiveness and other road offences drastically reduce.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, many people are currently employed in industries because of their ability to drive. Taxi’s, Ride
            Shares and perhaps even buses would all lose the need to employ an actual driver and still offer the same
            service. Tens of thousands are employed in this industry in Australia alone and would be without work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The freight industry would also be affected, local deliveries could be replaced but the most significant
            change would likely be in long distance trucking. While truck drivers are restricted in the number of hours
            they are allowed to work within a given time to ensure the health and safety of the driver and other members
            of the community, such a regulation would likely not apply to autonomous vehicles. Being able to drive
            almost constantly is an economic and logistical prospect traditional drivers will simply be unable to
            compete with.
          </p>
          <h3>How will this affect me?</h3>
          <p>
            Currently I am able to drive myself but avoid doing so in various conditions including high traffic and
            avoid major urban centres. With a personal autonomous vehicle, I would be more comfortable travelling to
            many locations. It would also reduce the effort required to travel interstate to my hometown or visiting
            family members spread around the country. Of course, the price of such a vehicle would be out of my price
            range at the moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Driver fatigue is one issue that contributes to morbidity and mortality. Falling asleep and micro-sleeps
            have resulted in head on collisions. Country roads can be especially hazardous. One lady from my town was
            hit head on whilst travelling on a weekday afternoon on a seven kilometre straight and sustained major
            injuries. The other driver, also a local studying away was returning home and had fallen asleep at the
            wheel. Swerving to avoid animals on the road such as cattle, kangaroos or camels has resulted in rollovers.
            Some people overtake when they shouldn’t, risking head on collisions when medical assistance could be a long
            time arriving. People used to drive in city conditions often do not overtake safely.
          </p>
          <p>
            My parents travel a lot on remote and outback roads as part of their work as remote teachers. OH&amp;S
            policy and procedures remove some of the risk. Scheduled breaks, vehicle inspections and 4-wheel driver
            training help with driver safety, They have recently been issued with government vehicles, a Subaru and a
            Kia Sportage fitted with blind spot and rear cross traffic assist, lane follow assist and adaptive cruise
            control. They have commented positively on how this has been useful when driving long distances. The
            vehicles automatically reduce speed when approaching a vehicle travelling slower in front of them or alert
            them to lane deviation. In particular driving to Coober Pedy or Ceduna from Adelaide has been easier on
            fatigue.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          This cleaning and chore scheduling app will assist users in organising a functional cleaning and chore
          checklist, with assorted tasks that need to be done with varying frequencies in all areas of the home. This
          checklist can also be viewed by other members of the household, and each person can have specific tasks or
          locations assigned to them throughout any given time period in order to help share the load.
        </p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          As someone who works full time and now studies part time, it is difficult to set up a cleaning structure at
          home. It’s very easy to just get home and do nothing. Something like this sending reminders out to do specific
          things every now and then could hopefully be the little push needed to help motivate one to perform cleaning
          duties throughout the week.
        </p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          This app will have numerous features in order to help you to keep your house clean.While setting up this app,
          you will add in the number of rooms and separate areas in your house, with the ability to give each its own
          unique name. Additionally, multiple users can download the app and share information via the cloud. Any users
          can also be added to the same home and have tasks assigned to them. Notifications and reminders will be
          utilised on the day the task is due to be completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will also be a list of cleaning tasks predefined such as vacuuming, dusting, clean windows, and so on.
          Each room will have its own list of tasks depending on the room itself, so your bedroom would have “change
          sheets, wipe down bedside table, clean windows” and depending on the contents of the bedroom, could also have
          “clean mirror, wipe down fan, etc”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each individual task will also have its own suggested frequency which can be altered at will. Changing sheets
          could be once a week, vacuuming three times a week, mowing the lawns once every two weeks, take the bins out
          every Wednesday and put on a load of laundry every two days.Users can be added and assigned tasks to be
          completed. So, John could vacuum “Johns room” on Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays. An alternative assignment
          process would be by task. So once a week, Sally could clean all windows in the home. There will be multiple
          ways to view tasks to be done. By timespan will give an overview of everything to be done that day/week/month.
          By room will give an overview of each room/area and all tasks to be completed within. By user will give an
          overview of each user and all tasks assigned to them. Once completed tasks will be checked off until the next
          time the are due to be completed.
        </p>
        <h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
        <p>
          The only hardware needed for this application is a phone or tablet. Software needed would be along the lines
          of Swift and /or Android Studio for app development, and an emulator in order to test. Microsoft Azure or
          something similarcloud computing services to make data synchronisation between devices. Also there are free
          cloud storage services like DropBox, Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive which allow to share and synchronise
          files for various devices. Internet access is needed touse these services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Photoshop, Sketch or Wireframe.cc for creating wireframes and general design for the app. The desk top and
          laptop version for operation systems MS Widows and Linux can be developed for people without smart phones or
          tablets. A suitable programming language for this project is Python. Python is an open source, portable
          general-purpose programming language, one of the most popular (if not the most popular) programming language
          in the world at the moment. It has a simple syntax and is easy to study and use for beginners; it allows rapid
          software development with code of two –three times less in size than other programming languages. Despite its
          simplicity, Python has capabilities to write sophisticated software like other older well-knownprogramming
          languages as C++ or Java, in various domains. For instance, there is Python SDK for APIto integrate connection
          and synchronisation of data files with DropBox into Python application.
        </p>
        <p>
          To develop Graphic User Interface (GUI) for the program, the standard Python library Tkinter (Python Software
          Foundation,2022) can be used (the standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit), which is available for
          a number of platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux, andUnix. That is a simple, straightforward, easy to learn,
          proven module for quick building of not complex GUI. It uses very little code to build a functional desk top
          application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Source control management system (SKMS) can be used to help software development group to keep changes and
          updates to program code under control. It allows each developer to work on software separately and remotely
          and merge their work results into the final version. One of the popular SKMS is cloud service GitHub (GitHub,
          2022). It works on Windows,iOS and Android platforms and contains more than 200 million repositories at the
          moment (GitHub, 2022).Skills Required
        </p>
        <h3>Skills required</h3>
        <p>
          Programming language knowledge, such as Python, Java, Swift and/or C++ and skills in use some IDEs for these
          languages. Decent proficiency using software such as Photoshop, Sketch and Wireframe.cc in order to create the
          overall layout, graphics and design for the app. Some skills in GUI design and implementation are needed too.
          Also programmers should be capable to develop some data structures for this software. Overall the necessary
          skills should be relatively easy to develop though study, trial and error.To formulate technical requirements
          for the software, skills to communicate and collaborate with people and family members are in need too,
          allocating home works is not an easy task sometimes.
        </p>
        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>
          The successful use of this app will help maintain order and cleanness in a household. Whether you’re living
          alone and just need reminders of what to clean and how often to clean without trying to get it all done in one
          hit and getting overwhelmed. Or if you share your house with housemates or family you can distribute tasks
          fairly throughout the household in order to share the load, being sent updates when communal areas have been
          cleaned or notifications when a task is coming up to be due, or if it is overdue.
        </p>
        <p>
          This would be particularly impactful for families with teenagers who can spend a lot of time on their devices.
          If a task isn’t completed on time this would open opportunities for conversational development, where you can
          detail how much work has been completed by other members of the household compared to someone who isn’t doing
          their part.This software can be extended not only for scheduling cleaning tasks but also for allocating other
          kinds of homework among homestead dwellers.
